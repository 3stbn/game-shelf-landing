        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application "Game Shelf" (the "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Esteban Torres. The Application organizes video games into categories such as backlog, in progress, completed, and wish list. The Application consumes data from https://rawg.io/.</p>
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The Application does not collect any personal information from users. The Application only stores the IP address of the user for the purpose of rate limiting. All users are anonymous as there is no login system. All data is stored on the user's mobile device.</p>
        <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>The Application does not share any information with third parties.</p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>The Application is designed to store all data on the user's mobile device and does not transmit any information over the internet. As such, the security of the data is dependent on the security of the user's mobile device.</p>
        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
